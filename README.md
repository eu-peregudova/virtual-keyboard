# Virtual keyboard
This project was done by me at [RSSchool](https://rs.school/index.html) JS course.

It taught me how to use event handlers, local storage, and a bunch of minor stuff. 
Also, one of the requirements was to use es-lint. I hated it, but I think my coding habits became healthier.

Challenges I faced while doing it:

- I wanted to use classes very badly, but I didn't know where to use them.
- I chose an approach that made it difficult to handle keyboard and screen touches at the same time.
- Also, my initial approach worked great for keyboard clicks, but it didn't work well for screen interactions.
- My code was a mess. I tried to clean it, but I think it's still kind of messy. 
- It was my biggest project yet, so I didn't know how to properly plan the work in advance.
- Due to the mess, I had situations where fixing one thing ruined the other. That was very fun.

Despite the challenges, this was very useful to me. 
It helped me gain more experience with event handlers and other JS concepts. And I feel more secure about my career choise. 
I also have more idea now about how to plan small projects.
